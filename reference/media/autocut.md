# `dapi media autocut <path>`

Proposes **keep-ranges** for a CapCut-style jump cut by composing [`dapi media waveform`](./waveform.md) silence detection with [`dapi media transcribe`](./transcribe.md) word timings. Does not re-encode or write media — it returns second ranges (and optionally a JSX `<sequence>`) for trimming with `sourceIn` / `sourceOut`.

Dropped spans:

- **Silences** — from the waveform analyzer (same amplitude threshold as `media waveform`), kept only when at least `--silence-min` long.
- **Stutters** — immediate repeated words (`"I I think"`).
- **Fillers** — vocal pauses (`um`, `uh`, `eh`, `em`, …) and a few safe phrases (`you know`, `i mean`, `o sea`, `es decir`). Real conjunctions and adverbs (`so`, `like`, `well`, `vale`, …) are not dropped.

All times are **source/content seconds**, the same clock as [`media transcribe`](./transcribe.md) and [`media waveform`](./waveform.md). Waveform `silences[]` are absolute source seconds (when `--start`/`--end` narrow the window, silence timestamps are still offset into source time, not relative to the window).

## Input

- `<path>`: a local video or audio file, or a project library path (library paths need an open project).
- `-s, --start <time>`: start of the window to analyze, a `Time` value (optional; default `0`). Passed through to waveform silence detection; transcript words outside the window are ignored.
- `-e, --end <time>`: end of the window (optional; default the asset's duration).
- `--silence-min <seconds>`: drop silences at least this long (optional; default `0.4`). The waveform's amplitude threshold is fixed in the app.
- `--pad <seconds>`: keep this much audio on each side of a cut (optional; default `0.05`).
- `--lang <code>`: filler vocabulary — `en`, `es`, or `all` (optional; default `all`).
- `--jsx`: include a JSX `<sequence>` of `<video>` or `<audio>` clips with `sourceIn` / `sourceOut` for each kept span (optional).

Transcription uses cloud STT when signed in (cached like `media transcribe`). When transcription fails or no speech is detected, the command continues with **silence-only** cuts.

## Output

One JSON object:

```ts
{
  duration: number,
  keep: Array<{ start: number, end: number }>,  // source seconds to keep
  removed: {
    silences: Array<{ start: number, end: number }>,
    fillers: Array<{ start: number, end: number }>,
    stutters: Array<{ start: number, end: number }>,
  },
  jsx?: string,  // when --jsx; video uses probe width/height when present, audio uses <audio>
}
```

Times are in **source/content seconds**, the same clock as `transcribe` and `waveform`.

## Errors

Exits non-zero if the path can't be resolved, probe can't read a duration, the asset has no decodable audio, or flags are invalid.

When the audio has no recognizable speech or cloud STT is unavailable, the command continues with silence-only cuts and prints a note to stderr.

## Example

```sh
